          <p>The man who had acquired everything in this world, the Pirate King, is Gol D. Roger. The final words he said at the execution tower were "My treasures? If you want it, I'll let you have it. Look for it; I left all of it at that place." These words sent many to the seas, chasing their dreams, headed toward the Grand Line, in search of One Piece. And a new age began! Seeking to be the greatest pirate in the world, young Monkey D. Luffy also heads toward the Grand Line in search of One Piece. With his diverse crew joining him along the way, consisting of a swordsman, marksman, navigator, cook, doctor, archaeologist, and cyborg-shipwright, this will be one memorable adventure.</p>        </div>

However, the two are suddenly forced to part ways when Piao is recruited to work in the royal palace by a retainer of the King.</p>
